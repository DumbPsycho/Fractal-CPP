# Fractal-CPP
This program renders the Mandelbrot set in an 8-bit [.PPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) format. The coloring is escape-time based, every pixel is colored based on the number of iterations it goes through before tending to infinity. Realtime rendering and keyboard input with some basic UI is planned.
