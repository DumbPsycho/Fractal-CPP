# Fractals-CPP
This repos contains a program that renders the [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) set. It uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) and is also multi-threaded. It has basic keyboard and mouse input. 

# Controls
* W -> Move up
* S -> Move down
* A -> Move left
* D -> Move right
* Space -> Write screenshot(screenshots are [PPMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) for now)
* Mouse Wheel up -> Increase iterations
* Mouse Wheel down -> Decrease iterations
* Left click -> Zoom in
* Right Click -> Zoom out

# TODO
* Basic GUI 
* Customizable coloring functions
* PNG screenshots instead of PPM
* Other fractals
